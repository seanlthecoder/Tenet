## Sean's Work Day Scheduler


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule <br />
WHEN I open the planner <br />
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar <br />
WHEN I scroll down <br />
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours <br />
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day <br />
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future <br />
WHEN I click into a time block <br />
THEN I can enter an event <br />
WHEN I click the save button for that time block <br />
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage <br />
WHEN I refresh the page <br />

## basic info

The motivation behind this project was to create a browser based scheduling platform that allows users to store data in local storage.

While building this app I learned how to retrieve saved text from local storage and display it in the corresponding text area element and to apply certain classes to text area elements based on current time.

I also continued my learning of 'if' and 'else' statements along with continued learning of click event handler for elements.
